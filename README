Acknowledgements:
The TAs in Office Hours were helpful in identifying causes of incorrect output
in the testing of our code as well as explaining concepts relating to
probable causes of segfaults and incorrect pointer references.

Neil, Alec, Sruthi, Josh, Eric, Alec, and more were helpful. There may be more
TAs I don't remember off the top of my head.

Files with correct implementations (2/2):
- Readaline
